Installing the testing tool.
----------------------------

I intend to use the selenium RC test tool

This is a java-based server that sits on the test machine, and sends
commands to the javascript-based app on the browser.  The server
interprets commands sent to it, over the network, by a client, which
can be Python.

So, in short, I can write a Python file (UnitTest) that sends commands
to a remote PC (or virtual instance) and that will run selenium tests, on Ubuntu, XP etc etc.


1. Download Selenium-rc from seleniumhq.org
2. Extract the rc and follow the install instructions
3. run the Selenium *server* on the testing machine ::

  java -jar $LOC/selenium-server.jar

4. get the client script working, by downloading the python extension.
   This is basically a library and some examples.  


::

  cp selenium.py /usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/
  cp selenium.py /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/ #this works for ubuntu



Reporting
---------

`HTMLTestRunner
 <http://tungwaiyip.info/software/HTMLTestRunner.html>`_ is a seperate
 script that, basically wraps UnitTest and outputs html with Pie
 charts, HTML table for easy viewing of all tests.

  
This is really good.  All you do for basic use if import then replace the unittest run 
with ::

    import unittest
    import HTMLTestRunner

    ... define your tests ...

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        HTMLTestRunner.main()
